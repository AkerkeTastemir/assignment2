## 1. Algorithm Overview

**Boyer–Moore Majority Vote** is a linear-time algorithm used to find the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times in an array, if such an element exists.

It operates in two distinct phases:

1. **Candidate Selection:**  
   Iterates through the array maintaining a `candidate` and a `count`.  
   When `count` becomes zero, the algorithm selects a new candidate.

2. **Candidate Verification:**  
   Counts occurrences of the candidate to confirm whether it is the majority element.

**Key properties:**
- Single-pass majority detection with an additional verification step.
- Constant auxiliary space.
- Handles all edge cases (empty arrays, no majority, duplicates).

## 2. Asymptotic Complexity Analysis

### Standard Implementation

- **Phase 1:** One linear scan → `O(n)`
- **Phase 2:** One verification scan → `O(n)`
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(2n)` → `O(n)` overall

| Case | Time Complexity (Big-O) | Time Complexity (Θ) | Time Complexity (Ω) |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Best (Majority early)** | O(n) | Θ(n) | Ω(n) |
| **Average (Random)** | O(n) | Θ(n) | Ω(n) |
| **Worst (No majority)** | O(n) | Θ(n) | Ω(n) |

**Space Complexity:**
- In-place algorithm
- Auxiliary space: **Θ(1)**

## 3. Code Review and Optimization Suggestions

### Strengths
- ✅ **Correctness:** Handles all array types and edge cases.
- ✅ **Efficiency:** Linear time, constant space — asymptotically optimal.
- ✅ **Clean integration:** Works seamlessly with `PerformanceTracker`.
- ✅ **Clarity:** Code is well-structured and readable.

### Potential Improvements
- ✅ **Early-exit optimization:** During verification, stop if remaining elements can’t exceed the threshold.
- ✅ **Refactor phases:** Extract `findCandidate()` and `verifyCandidate()` methods for readability.
- ✅ **Minor detail:** Combine null/empty checks for cleaner flow.

## 4. Empirical Results

**Benchmark Results (from `majority_benchmark.csv`):**

| n | hasMajority | timeNs | comparisons | arrayAccesses | assignments |
|---|--------------|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| 100 | false | 63,792 | 200 | 200 | 125 |
| 1,000 | false | 564,750 | 2,000 | 2,000 | 1,241 |
| 10,000 | false | 1,919,625 | 20,000 | 20,000 | 12,551 |
| 100,000 | false | 8,255,250 | 200,000 | 200,000 | 125,065 |

**Analysis:**
- Linear growth confirms **O(n)** time complexity.
- Constant ratio between operations and input size.
- Memory use remains constant across all tests.
- Theoretical and empirical results fully align.
